# Chibotle

Over the 2023 NBA Finals, Chipotle released codes for a free entree via Twitter whenever a 3-pointer was scored. This bot uses the Twitter API to grab tweets from the Chipotle Twitter account in real-time. Upon receipt of the tweet and code, the bot sends an SMS message to the Chipotle number to receive the free entree gift.
